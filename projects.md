# Creating a project

### 03-15-2024

- GitHub provides a project feature for you (and your coding buddies) to track the progress of a project.
- And the steps to create a project is very simple.
1. Go to your menu by clicking the profile picture on the top right corner of the github dashboard.

4. Choose a layout that fit your need or you preferred. (in this case, I choose table because it is clean and I am the only one working on this project right now.)
